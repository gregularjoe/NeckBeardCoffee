# Neck Beard Coffee

## Description

This project is a personal endeavor aimed at refining my skills. It involves developing a website for a fictional coffee company called Neck Beard Coffee using Angular 18. The project incorporates AI-generated assets, including product images and logos. My objective is to create a fully functional site featuring OAuth authentication, a backend API, and a database (which are yet to be implemented). The site will also include an online shop and additional features that are still under development. This project is a work in progress and will take some time to complete. I welcome any feedback, tips, or contributions. Please feel free to reach out.
